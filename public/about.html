    <h1> About Me!</h1>
    <h2>Hi there! My name is Fure</h2>. 
    <h3>I'm an 18 year old girl trying to make her way into the male-dominated field of tech. </h3>
    <p1>I'm a junior back-end developer currently learning Node.js and Django.</p1>
    <p2>Finding female representation in the tech industry as a young Nigerian woman is incredibly tasking, so I resolved to become a part of the growing demographic and hopefully go on to inspire other young girls to get into tech as well.</p2>
